    <p class="description">
      My primary focus is on the web domain, but I am a person with ideals and I plan to start writing my own operating system kernel in the near future because I am against technological ecosystems.

    <h2>ðŸ˜º Additional</h2>
    <p class="description">
      However, my life is not limited to programming compared to other people, I am interested in theoretical, atomic and quantum physics, and my other goal in the future is to combine physics with my programming skills. Other than that, I like listening to music, doing math (except problems) and computer science.
